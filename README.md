# Setup preferred tooling
Personal choices. Tested in Ubuntu.

```
git clone https://github.com/sjtoik/vm-setup.git
cd vm-setup
sh 02_sway.sh
```

Switched back to i3 as Sway/Wayland didn't support Nvidia enough to enable external display ports. 
There are still problems in some combinations of power modes. 
External display requires hard reboot before appearing in the xrandr output again.
